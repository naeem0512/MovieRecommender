# Movie Recommender (ML Project)

This project is a movie recommendation system that leverages multiple collaborative filtering techniques, including user-based and item-based collaborative filtering, as well as matrix factorisation using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). The system combines these methods to provide hybrid recommendations to users.

## Project Objective

As an aspiring data scientist eager to enter the world of machine learning, I chose to develop a movie recommendation system for my project. This decision was driven by my interest in understanding complex algorithms and my passion for leveraging data to enhance user experiences. Through this project, I am gaining hands-on experience in data preprocessing, collaborative filtering, Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), and model evaluation. By the end of this project, I will have not only built a functional recommendation system but also deepened my understanding of various recommendation techniques. This experience is a significant step toward my goal of becoming a skilled data scientist, capable of transforming theoretical knowledge into practical applications that can drive business insights and innovation.

## Features

- **User-based Collaborative Filtering:** Recommends movies based on the similarity between users.
- **Item-based Collaborative Filtering:** Recommends movies based on the similarity between items (movies).
- **Singular Value Decomposition (SVD):** Matrix factorization technique to predict missing entries in the user-item matrix.
- **Hybrid Recommendation:** Combines the strengths of user-based, item-based, and SVD methods to provide robust recommendations.
- **Model Evaluation:** Includes functions to evaluate the performance of the recommendation system using Mean Squared Error (MSE), precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the MovieLens dataset, which contains user ratings for various movies.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or higher
- pip package manager

### Dependencies

Install the required packages using the following command:

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Here are the dependencies listed in the requirements.txt file:**

- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- requests
- flask
- flask-cors
- seaborn
- matplotlib

## Usage
### Running the Recommendation System
Clone the Repository:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/naeem0512/MovieRecommender.git
cd MovieRecommender
```

Run the Python Script:
```sh
python MovieRecommender.py
```

## Flask API
A simple Flask API is provided to get movie recommendations for a user.

#### Start the Flask Server:
```sh
python MovieRecommender.py
```

**Make API Requests:** 
You can make GET requests to the /recommend endpoint to get movie recommendations for a user. For example:
```sh
curl "http://127.0.0.1:5000/recommend?user_id=1&num_recommendations=5"
```

## File Descriptions
- **MovieRecommender.py:** Main script containing the implementation of the recommendation system and the Flask API. You can run this script directly to see the recommendation system in action.
- **MovieRecommender.ipynb:** Jupyter Notebook containing the implementation and step-by-step explanation of the recommendation system. This notebook is ideal for those who prefer a more detailed exploration of the code with explanations and insights into how each component works.
- **requirements.txt:** List of dependencies required to run the project. Ensure these packages are installed to successfully run the scripts.

Feel free to explore both the .py and .ipynb files to gain a complete understanding of how the recommendation system functions and how it has been developed. Each file offers a unique perspective and depth to the project, catering to different learning styles and technical approaches.

## Conclusion
This project has been incredibly rewarding, laying a solid foundation for my understanding and implementation of various recommendation techniques. By experimenting with user-based, item-based, and hybrid approaches, I have gained valuable insights into the intricacies of building and evaluating recommendation systems. Each phase of the project challenged me to think critically and creatively, enhancing my problem-solving skills and deepening my appreciation for data-driven decision-making. The experience has not only bolstered my technical expertise but also reinforced my passion for data science as a means to create impactful solutions.

Feel free to explore, modify, and enhance the project. Contributions are welcome!

## Contributing
Developing the **MovieRecommender** Flask app has been one of the most challenging yet rewarding parts of this project.
